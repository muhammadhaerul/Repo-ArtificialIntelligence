## Dataset Description:
This dataset contains the Air Pollution Standard Index (ISPU) measured from 5 stations
air quality monitors (SPKU) in DKI Jakarta Province in 2021.
The explanation of the variables from the data above is as follows:
1. date: Date of air quality measurement
2. station: Measurement location at the station
3. pm10: Particulate one of the measured parameters
4. pm25: Particulate one of the measured parameters
5. so2: Sulfide (in the form of SO2) one of the measured parameters
6. co: Carbon Monoxide is one of the measured parameters
7. o3: Ozone one of the measured parameters
8. no2: Nitrogen dioxide one of the measured parameters
9. max: The highest measurement value of all parameters measured at the same time
10. critical: Parameter with the highest measurement result
11. Category: Category calculation result of air pollution standard index
